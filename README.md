Pixly is a compact, ESP32-powered accessory designed specifically for the Bambu Lab A1, A1 Mini 3D printer. It replaces the original hotend faceplate with a custom 3D-printed enclosure (the "Box") that houses a vibrant 2.4" touchscreen display.

📡 Live Status Display
Pixly connects to your A1 via Wi-Fi and presents real-time print data—such as print progress, temperatures, and fan speeds—right at the print head. This localised status view makes monitoring more intuitive and visually engaging.

🎮 8-Bit Aesthetic
All visuals are styled in charming 8-bit pixel art, giving your printer a retro personality. Animations and icons are custom-designed to blend nostalgic design with functional UX.

🧠 Powered by ESP32
At its core is a single integrated module combining the ESP32 SoC with the 2.4" TFT, delivering reliable connectivity and rendering performance without external components.

🔧 Modular and Maker-Friendly
Pixly is open to customisation. Designed by a maker, for makers—it’s fully programmable, allowing users to expand its features or adapt it for different printer models.

🛠️ Easy Mounting
The enclosure is engineered to replace the Bambu Lab A1's default hotend faceplate, securing Pixly in a clean, integrated form factor.
