Introduction: This doesn‚Äôt make my prints any better‚Ä¶ but it does make my printer look way cooler üòÇ

A compact, ESP32-powered accessory designed specifically for the Bambu Lab A1, A1 Mini 3D printer. It replaces the original hotend faceplate with a custom 3D-printed enclosure (the "Box") that houses a vibrant 2.4" touchscreen display.

üì° Live Status Display
PrintpooP connects to your A1 via Wi-Fi and presents real-time print data, such as print progress, temperatures, fan speeds, and Clock. Right at the print head. This localised status view makes monitoring more intuitive and visually engaging.

üéÆ 8-Bit Aesthetic
All visuals are styled in charming 8-bit pixel art, giving your printer a retro personality. Animations and icons are custom-designed to blend nostalgic design with functional UX and sound effects.

üõ†Ô∏è Easy Mounting
The enclosure is engineered to replace the Bambu Lab A1's default hotend faceplate, securing PrintpooP in a clean, integrated form factor.
