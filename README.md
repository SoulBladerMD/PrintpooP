## Pixly ‚Äì Retro Pixel Smart Display for Bambu Lab A1

Pixly is a compact, ESP32-powered accessory designed specifically for the Bambu Lab A1, A1 Mini 3D printer. It replaces the original hotend faceplate with a custom 3D-printed enclosure (the "Box") that houses a vibrant 2.4" touchscreen display.

üì° Live Status Display
Pixly connects to your A1 via Wi-Fi and presents real-time print data ‚Äîsuch as print progress, temperatures, fan speeds, and Clock ‚Äîright at the print head. This localised status view makes monitoring more intuitive and visually engaging.

üéÆ 8-Bit Aesthetic
All visuals are styled in charming 8-bit pixel art, giving your printer a retro personality. Animations and icons are custom-designed to blend nostalgic design with functional UX.

üß† Powered by ESP32
At its core is a single integrated module combining the ESP32 SoC with the 2.4" TFT, delivering reliable connectivity and rendering performance without external components.

üõ†Ô∏è Easy Mounting
The enclosure is engineered to replace the Bambu Lab A1's default hotend faceplate, securing Pixly in a clean, integrated form factor.
